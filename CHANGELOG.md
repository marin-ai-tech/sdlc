# Changelog

All notable changes to scdl. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); while the major version is 0, a minor version may change behavior.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-30

### Added
- **AI-ready project layout** (`docs/en/07-ai-ready-project.md`): ten document roles with canonical paths and common aliases — `AGENTS.md` as the main agent guide, a thin `CLAUDE.md` that imports it, `README.md`, `REVIEW.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `conventions.md`, `glossary.md`, `runbook.md`, `security.md` and `docs/decisions/`. Templates for every role in `assets/project/ai-ready/`.
- `sdlc layout check`: readiness per role (canonical, mapped, alias, missing), `ready` and a 0–100 score.
- `sdlc layout scaffold`: creates the missing documents from templates; never overwrites.
- `sdlc layout adapt`: adaptation mode — records documents found at aliases in the new `layout:` section of `openspec/sdlc.yaml` and creates only what is missing; moves nothing.
- `sdlc layout convert`: conversion mode — a dry-run plan by default; `--apply` converts in a new git worktree on a new branch and commits there, leaving the main working copy untouched; `--in-place` converts the current working copy. Moves use `git mv`; relative Markdown links are rewritten; pinned paths and `openspec/` are never moved. Agent sessions may plan but not apply in worktree mode.
- `sdlc report --format md|json|html [--since] [--change] [--out]`: progress report with stages, blocked changes, changes awaiting a person, lead-time medians, verification first-pass rate, project-log events and layout readiness.
- `sdlc dashboard`: the same model as one self-contained HTML page (no network, light and dark themes, responsive).

### Changed
- Lead-time metrics are shared by `sdlc audit` and the report.
- `dist/` is built on install by the `prepare` script and is no longer expected in git.

### Fixed
- Every file copied from the package (plugin legal files, the OpenSpec schema and templates) is emitted with LF; `.gitattributes` enforces LF checkouts.

## 0.1.0

Initial release: lifecycle stages and gates on top of OpenSpec, content-bound approvals, separation of duties, verification evidence, multi-pass review, deterministic guardrails for Claude Code and OpenCode, audit and metrics.
